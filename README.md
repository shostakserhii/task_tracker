# Task Tracker Backend

This is a minimal task tracker backend built using FastAPI.\
It provides generic endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks, as well as user authentication and authorization.\
A lot of things could be done better (e.g. project structure breakdown, more roles, constraints on the users/assignee/reporter, alembic, etc), but that should be good to go for developer screening :)

## Features
- User authentication and authorization
- CRUD operations for Task management
- Role-based access control (admin and read-only roles)
- JWT token-based authentication
- Email sending mock up to reporter when status of the task is changed

## Requirements
- Docker

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shostakserhii/task_tracker.git
    cd task_tracker
    ```

2. Build the Docker image:
    ```bash
    docker build -t task_tracker .
    ```

3. Run the Docker container:
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name task_tracker task_tracker
    ```

4. Access the API documentation:

    Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/docs` to see the automatically generated Swagger documentation.

5. First of all you need to create users via /post/users/ endpoint.\
    You can create users with different roles (admin, read-only) and assign them to tasks.\
    Admin can use all endpoints while\ read-only can only use GET endpoints talking about Task API.
6. Go to the Authorize button in the top right corner of the Swagger UI ![auth button](./pic/auth_button.png) and log in under the EXISTING user. You just need email and password.\
7. Each session lives 30 minutes. After that you need to Authorize again.

## Running Tests

You can also verify basic functionality with the functional tests.\
To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

2. Run the tests using `pytest`:
    ```bash
    poetry run pytest -v --disable-warnings
    ```
## Environment Variables
The following environment variables can be changed to configure the application (in case needed):
- `DATABASE_URL`: The database URL to connect to (default: `sqlite:///./test.db`).

## If you prefer to test it with Postman or Curl here are endpoints:
### Authentication
- `POST /token`: Obtain a JWT token.

### Users
- `POST /users/`: Create a new user.

### Tasks
- `POST /tasks/`: Create a new task (admin only).
- `GET /tasks/`: Get a list of tasks (read_only and admin).
- `GET /tasks/{task_id}`: Get a task by its ID (read_only and admin).
- `PUT /tasks/{task_id}`: Update a task by its ID (admin only).
- `DELETE /tasks/{task_id}`: Delete a task by its ID (admin only).
